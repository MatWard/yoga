            <h2>Welcome to the amazing world of Yoga</h2>
            <p><img src="images/yoga-symbol.jpg" class id="yoga_symbol" width="170" height="180"><p>
        I have been teaching yoga since 1979 having trained with the <a href="http://www.bwy.org.uk/">British Wheel of Yoga</a> and <a href="//www.friendsofyoga.co.uk/">Friends of Yoga International</a>. It has been a real joy to teach people of all ages to a wide variety of groups. That is the amazing thing about Yoga &#45; it can be practised and enjoyed no matter what your age, background or ability.</p>
    
        <p>The word <b>Yoga</b> means Union &#40;yoke&#41; and is an ancient discipline.
        </p>
        <p>
            Hatha yoga combines</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Movement &#40;asana&#41;</li>               <li>Breath control &#40;pranayama&#41;</li>
            <li>Concentration</li>
            <li>Deep relaxation</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            With regular practice it brings suppleness, strength and stamina to the body. At the same time it concentrates, relaxes and stills the mind.
        </p>
        <p>
        All you need is the will to give it a try, a small mat or rug to work on, and a little space to stretch...you will be amazed.

            <h2>How to use this website</h2>
            <p>
        The purpose of this website is to help you get started, point you in the right direction and give you references to help you along the way. If you live close enough you can even come along to one of my classes and try it with me&#33;
        </p>
        <p>
        If you look at the tabs at the top of this page you will find your way to some useful pages that I have put together for geting started. I have a basic introduction into the origins and fundemental principles of Hatha Yoga.There is also a page of beginner exercises for you to follow and try for yourself. Its always good to be shown the correct techniques by a qualified teacher. So if you're nearby then I've also included details of my classes and available private one on one or small group sessions. But there are classes all over and you won't have any trouble finding a class near to where you live. Finally I've listed some useful online resources for you to do some further reading if you'd like to
        </p>

        I hope you find my website useful and that this is just the beginning of your journey into the amazing world of Yoga.
