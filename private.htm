            <ol>
                <li>Work at your own pace if you feel a regular class is not for you</li><br>

                <li>You may have health issues and you wish to focus on using yoga to aid recovery</li><br>

                <li>Your life may be too busy to fit in a regular session requiring flexibility to fit in sessions around your schedule</li><br>

                <li>Develop a tailored daily practice routine</li><br>

                <li>You may be part of a small group who wish to explore the practice and benefits of yoga together</li><br>

                <li>You may be part of an organisation working with the elderly or people with special needs. The practice of yoga offers therapeutic support to children, young people and adults with special needs, with the intention of helping them to enjoy each session and reach their full potential</li>
            </ol>

<p>Whatever the reason, a one to one experience will enable you to have a unique yoga class tailored to meet your own personal, emotional and physical requirements.
